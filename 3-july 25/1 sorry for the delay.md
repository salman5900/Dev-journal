## 💻 Still Working Behind the Scenes

- ✅ I **completed MARK1** — the full app is done.
- 🛠️ Ran into some **database issues** during deployment, so I’ve been debugging that.
- 💼 Got my **first freelance project in a while**! Been working on that in parallel.
- 🎓 Had to attend and prep for my **terminal college exams**, so it’s been a juggle between projects, studies, and mental energy.

## 📌 Looking Ahead

Even though I wasn’t able to journal daily, I **never stopped working** on myself and my goals.  
This journal helps me stay grounded — and I’ll do my best to **get back to consistency** from here on.

Every step counts. Even if it’s not daily. Even if it’s not perfect.  
What matters is: **I’m still in the game**. 💪
