## 😄 Feeling Good — Internet Fixed & New Project!

Today was a genuinely happy day for me.  
After struggling with Wi-Fi issues for the past couple of weeks, I finally made the switch to **Airtel broadband** — and it’s working smoothly! ⚡ Internet is stable again, and that’s a big relief for someone like me who lives and breathes code.

## 💼 New Freelance Project: "Mahal App"

I also started working on a new **freelance project** through a friend.  
It’s a **community-based application** where users can store and manage:

- 🏘️ House listings
- 📅 Local programs/events
- 📊 Other relevant data

The app is called **Mahal**, and it’s being built with:

- 🔧 **Django** on the backend
- 🎨 **Tailwind CSS** for styling
- 🖥️ Hosted on **Render (planned)**

I’m planning to post it soon on **GitHub** and eventually showcase it on **LinkedIn** once it’s polished.

## 🐧 Switched to Linux (via WSL)

Big update: I’ve **completely switched my dev workflow to Linux using WSL** (Windows Subsystem for Linux).  
Now I:

- Use **Ubuntu** through WSL for coding and server-related tasks
- Still enjoy the **comfort and flexibility of Windows**
- Store all project files inside the Linux environment for smooth performance

This setup gives me the **best of both worlds**, and I’m loving it!

## 🧠 Final Thoughts

It feels good to be productive again — working on both freelance projects and personal passion projects.  
I’m learning, growing, and getting better every day — one line of code at a time. 💻🚀
