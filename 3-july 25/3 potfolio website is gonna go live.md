## 🛠️ Learning Postgres & Rebuilding My Portfolio

Today, I started learning **PostgreSQL**!  
I set it up on **Windows** using **pgAdmin**, got some test data, and I’m beginning to explore and understand how it works. For now, I’ll learn it on Windows since it’s more convenient, but I’ll apply that knowledge across both environments eventually.

## 🌐 New Portfolio In the Works

I also began building a **new portfolio website**!  
Yes, I had one before — but it was built 1–2 years ago when I had just started coding. It was simple and decent for that stage, but now I’ve outgrown it.

This new one will:

- Showcase my projects more cleanly
- Reflect who I am now as a developer
- Be something I’ll proudly share on GitHub and LinkedIn

I’m also planning to buy a custom domain soon! 🔥

## 🎓 College Pressure vs Coding Passion

Lately, **college work has been piling up** — assignments, internal projects, and exams are making time tight.  
It’s tough balancing everything, and yes, there’s less time for coding and side projects.

But I’m **still pushing**, still learning, and still building — even if it’s just a little each day.  
No skipping. No quitting. The grind continues. 💪
