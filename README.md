# 🗓️ My Dev Journal

Welcome to my personal **Developer Journal**!  
Here, I share my progress, thoughts, and learnings as I work towards becoming a **full-stack web developer**.

I use a simple file naming convention:  
i name my file like this `2-June 25` next month file will be `3-July 25` this is to show the current status and to proprely organize one month after the other in the file system

Thanks for stopping by — and happy coding! 🚀
