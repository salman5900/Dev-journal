# 📝 Dev Journal — 2025-07-18

## ⚡ Current Status

Hey! I know I’ve been lagging a bit on posting here — exams have been hectic.  
For now, I’ve been **posting updates on LinkedIn** once or twice a week to keep a public log. This journal is more **raw and personal**, meant for myself — less polished, less for show.

## 🛠️ Dev Journey Update

Here’s what I’ve been up to recently:

- ✅ Completed **PostgreSQL** integration with Django  
- ✅ Finished **Django REST Framework (DRF)** tutorial  
- ✅ Built a **small Nautic application** (versions 1 & 2) to practice:
  - Multiple models  
  - Parent-child relationships  
  - API endpoints for CRUD operations  
- ✅ Feels like I’m **off the training wheels** — ready to build something more intermediate

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. Build **one intermediate-level project** to solidify concepts  
2. Brainstorm a strong idea for **MARK2**  
3. Move forward with MARK2 development

## 💡 Reflection

Even though posting has been inconsistent here, the learning never stops.  
I’m gradually moving from **tutorial-level projects** to building **real, intermediate/full-stack applications**.  
Excited for what’s coming next!
