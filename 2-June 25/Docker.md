## ⚡ Life Is Busy, But I’m Still Moving

I haven’t been able to post regularly lately — college is getting super busy. Even though the semester just started a month ago, we already have **unit exams** coming up and a lot of academic load. But still, I want to make it clear: **I’m not skipping or slacking.**

I’m **still coding every day**, putting in the work, even if I don’t always have time to post.

## ✅ MARK1 is Complete!

🎉 Big news: **MARK1 is fully built**!  
All features — chat systems, notifications, UI, and everything — are **done**.

## 🐳 Next Mission: Learn Docker

To make deployment smoother — especially for bigger apps like MARK1 — I’ve committed to learning **Docker**.  
For the next two days, I’ll be:
- Learning the basics of Docker
- Containerizing my app
- Setting up PostgreSQL + Redis inside containers
- Finally deploying with confidence

I want to make sure **“if it works on my machine, it works on the server too”** — and Docker is the way forward.

## 💬 Final Thought

I’m juggling college, exams, and code — but I’m not stopping.  
I’m learning, building, and solving problems as they come. This is what growth looks like.

Onwards! 🚀
