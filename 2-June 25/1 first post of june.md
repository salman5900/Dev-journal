## 🌟 A Fresh Start: New Month, New Energy!

It’s a new month!  
Last month, I started strong but didn’t always stay consistent.  
This month, I’m determined to **be more consistent** and keep that momentum going every single day — no matter how small the steps are!

## ✅ Noticeboard Feature — Done!

I also finished the **Noticeboard feature** in my app today.  
Feels awesome to check that off my list — one more step closer to launching my app and showing it to my friends!

## 🔥 Feeling Super Excited!

I’m really pumped about what’s coming next — can’t wait to keep learning and growing this month.  
Onwards and upwards!
