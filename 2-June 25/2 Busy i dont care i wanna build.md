## 🔧 Balancing College and Code

Hey! I'm a bit late with today’s entry — I missed yesterday because I had to focus on some **Java work for college**.  
College has officially started again, so things are going to be busier from now on. But still — no excuses.  
I’m fully committed to continuing my **full-stack development journey** alongside college, even if I can only spare an hour some days. Every step counts. 💪

## 🎨 UI Improvements & Redis Roadblocks

Today, I focused on a bit of **UI resizing and polishing** for my MARK1 application.  
These changes are laying the groundwork for **future PWA conversion**, which I’m super excited about!

On the backend, I ran into some trouble with the **Redis channel layer** — it's not connecting properly for caching.  
It’s working locally, but setting it up right for smoother message handling is still a work in progress. I’ll get there. 🔧

## ❤️ Why I Do This

I’m not doing this just for a job — I do this because **I genuinely love computer science**.  
I’ve always been into tech, gaming, and computers. But now, I want to go deeper.

I don’t just want to use technology — I want to **build and understand** it.  
Like a mechanic knows every part of a car, I want to know the ins and outs of how computers, apps, and systems work.  
I want to be the **builder, the problem-solver, the architect**.

## 🚀 Looking Ahead

I’ve got a lot to learn, and I’m ready for it.  
Even with college in full swing, I’ll keep showing up, learning, building, and pushing through.  
This is only the beginning — and I’m just getting warmed up.
