## 🚀 MARK1 is Dockerized & Launched on Render!

Today is a big win — I finally **Dockerized my MARK1 app** and successfully **launched it on Render**! 🐳🌐  
It’s live. It’s real. It’s working.

But let’s be honest — it’s **not perfect yet**.

There are still a few bugs showing up, some features acting weird in production, and certain things that worked smoothly in local development are now giving trouble in the deployed environment. But that’s okay. That’s part of the grind.

This is my **first time deploying a real full-stack, production-grade app with Docker**, PostgreSQL, WebSockets, Redis, and all that — and it’s a LOT to handle.

## 🧠 The Struggles Are Real

Man... let me rant for a second.

This part of the journey is hard.  
Not just technically — but **mentally**.  
Coding is fun when everything works. But when things break and you don’t even know why… it drains you.  
You sit there staring at logs, re-reading code, Googling the same issue 10 different ways — just to fix one thing.

Add to that **college + exams + sleep deprivation**, and it hits harder.  
But still — I’m here. Showing up. Learning. Building. Failing. Fixing.

## 💬 Final Words

I may be tired, but I’m **not giving up**.

MARK1 is alive. It’s not finished, but it’s out there.  
That’s more than most people ever do.

So I’ll take the bugs. I’ll take the errors. I’ll take the struggles.  
Because I know what I’m building will be worth it. One day at a time. 💻🔥
