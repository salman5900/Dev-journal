## 🔔 Notification System Added

Quick update — I just finished building the **Notification Feature**! 🎉

Now, whenever a user is invited to a club, the invite appears through a **central notification system**.  
All invite-related actions and alerts — **joins, discards, approvals, etc.** — are handled here.

It's clean, minimal, and super useful.  
This adds a real polish to the app and ties the whole club interaction experience together smoothly. 💬📩
