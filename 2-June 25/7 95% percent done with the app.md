# 📝 Dev Journal — 2025-06-18

Today’s a big day! 🎉

I’ve officially completed **95% of my MARK1 project**! The past few days were packed with college and other responsibilities, so I haven’t posted consistently — but I never stopped coding. I kept putting in the work, even if it was just an hour a day. That counts — and now we’re almost there. 💻🔥

✅ What’s Done:
MARK1 is nearly a complete, full-stack production-grade app:
- 👤 **User Authentication** (Signup, Login, Logout, Edit Profile)
- 🌐 **Global Chat**  
  — Real-time messaging  
  — WebSocket-powered  
  — Online users counter  
- 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 **Club System**  
  — Club creation  
  — Admin invites + user joining  
  — Club-only chat  
  — Leave/discard club  
- 🔔 **Notification System**  
  — Club invites and more  
  — Dynamic delivery and visual feedback  
- 🧑 **Profile Page**  
  — User info  
  — Editable fields  
- 🎨 Fully responsive and mobile-friendly **UI**
- 🧠 Structure built with performance and scalability in mind

🛠️ What’s Left:
- ⚙️ **Redis Caching Integration**
- 🗃️ **Database Migration** from SQLite → PostgreSQL
- 🔒 Final **Security Tweaks** (e.g., cleaning up URL params, tightening access)

This journal entry may be short — but it carries months of effort. I’m super excited, proud, and motivated to finish strong. Let's make this launch-worthy 🚀✨
