# 🚀 Dev Journal — 2025-05-18

## 👋 A New Beginning

Hey, my name is **Salman**.

For the past year or so, I’ve been playing around with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** — just for fun. 🧪  
But something clicked recently...

I realized that I **love coding** — and I want to make it my **career**.  
That shift in mindset changed everything. Now I’m on a mission to go from casual coder to serious developer. 💻🔥

Also, I have to say it —  
**I love Iron Man. He’s my favorite superhero. 🦾❤️**  
So yeah... if this journal feels a little Stark-inspired, that’s because it is. 😎

## 🛠️ My Dev Roadmap 

To guide my journey, I built a personal roadmap:

1. **Python** ✅  
2. **Django** ✅ *(Just got into it — and loving it!)*  
3. **SQL (MySQL/PostgreSQL)** 🔜  
4. **Django REST Framework (DRF)** 🔜  
5. **HTML + CSS** 🔜  
6. **JavaScript (Core)** 🔜  
7. **React.js** 🔜  
8. **Full-Stack Integration (React + Django)** 🔜  
9. **Next.js (After all the above)** 🔜  

Every step is a new armor piece. ⚙️🧑‍💻

## 🧪 First Builds (My Garage Experiments)

After just learning the basics of Django, I built a few simple apps with basic frontend skills and Django Basics:

- 📝 **Blog App** – My first Django CRUD blog.  
- 🔖 **Bookmark Manager** – Save and organize links.  
- 🗒️ **Notes App** – Minimal, clean note-taking.  

They were like early Stark suits — basic, but functional.

## ⚙️ MARK1 — My First Real Full-Stack Build

Now I’m working on something much bigger:  
### `MARK1 🧨` — A serious, production-ready student platform.

It includes:
- ✅ User Authentication  
- 💬 Real-time Global Chat  
- 🏫 Club System  
- 📢 Public Noticeboard  
- ⚡ Live Notifications  

MARK1 is my **first real suit**. Like Tony Stark in that cave — it’s not perfect, but it’s a serious step forward. This one’s **built to fly**. 🛫
FYI: Uses only `Django` ,`Django Template System`, `Html` and `CSS` and little `Bootstrap`

## 🎯 My Mission by 2027

Right now, I’m in my **second year of BSc Computer Science** at college. 🏫  
By the time I graduate in **2027**, I want to:

- Have built `MARK2`, `MARK3`, and `MARK4`  
- Be fully **job-ready**  
- Enter the dev world with confidence and skill  

This is my Iron Man arc. From raw builds to polished power suits. 💼🧠

## ❤️ Why I’m Doing This

I **love coding**.  
I love the feeling of building something from scratch.  
This is no longer just a hobby.  
**This is what I’ve chosen to do with my life.**

Let’s build. Let’s learn. Let’s launch.  
**~Salman a.k.a. Dev Stark**
