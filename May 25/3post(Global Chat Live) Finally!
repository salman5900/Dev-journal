## 🌐 Global Chat is Live!

**Super happy today** — the **Global Chat** feature for **MARK1** is finally complete and working smoothly!  
I didn’t post updates the last couple of days because I was completely focused on this.  
I ran into some tricky issues with **htmx** — the `ws-connect` approach was duplicating messages and only showing the real ones after a refresh. That was frustrating.

But I didn’t give up. Took some breaks, played around, and eventually ditched **htmx** for **vanilla JavaScript**.  
It turned out to be **super stable** and smooth — no duplication, no refresh issues. It feels solid now!

## 🎉 Feeling Super Stoked!

I’m really happy with how this turned out.  
I want everything I build to be **top-notch quality** — even if it takes a little longer.  
I’m aiming for production-ready, bug-free, smooth-as-butter apps. That’s the standard I’m setting for myself.

## ⚙️ Status:  
Global Chat is up and running!  
Next up: adding more features and refining the user experience.

Let’s keep the momentum going. 🚀
