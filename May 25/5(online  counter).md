## 🌟 A Quick Feature Day

Didn’t get to code much today because my older sister came back from her vacation in Dubai — had some family programs and other stuff going on.

But I didn’t let the day slip by!  
I added a **live counter** to the **Global Chat** feature to show how many people are online at any given moment.  
It’s a small but meaningful feature — it makes the app feel more connected and alive.

## 💪 Consistency Over Everything

Even if it’s just an hour or half an hour — it still counts.  
**I don’t skip a day**. Any work done is still progress.  
But **quality work** is always important to me — I never want to rush something that ends up buggy or half-baked.

That’s it for today — onwards and upwards! 🚀
