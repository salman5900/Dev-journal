## 🛠️ Profile Page Up and Running!

Today I took a step back from the **Websockets** feature and focused on the **Profile Page** for **MARK1**.

- Users can now view and edit their profile details.
- Kept it simple and functional for now — essentials first, polish later!

I wanted to make sure the **user experience** flows nicely and feels intuitive.  
A well-built profile page is a small but important piece of the bigger puzzle.

## 🔜 Next Steps

Tomorrow, I’ll switch gears and start working on the **group-based chat window** — a feature that will allow users to chat in specific club or interest-based rooms.  
Can’t wait to bring that to life!
