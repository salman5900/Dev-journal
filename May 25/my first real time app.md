## 🔧 Starting Global Chat for MARK1

Today I kicked off building the **Global Chat** feature for **MARK1** — the first real-time component of my app.

- I started designing the **UI** — aiming for clean, functional, and ready for live messages.
- Next, I'm diving into **WebSockets** and **Django Channels** to bring it to life.

I’ve never used Django Channels before, so I don’t fully understand how **WebSockets**, **consumers**, or **routing** work — *yet*.

But I’m not scared.  
This is what I signed up for. Learning by doing. ⚡

## 🧠 Notes to Self:
- Learn how Django Channels integrates WebSocket communication
- Understand `consumers.py`, `routing.py`, and `asgi.py`
- Plan to test chat in both global and room-specific views later

## ⚙️ Status:
MARK1 is officially stepping into **real-time mode**.  
This is where it starts to feel *alive*. 🦾
