## 👋 Hey! Back at It

I was busy the last couple of days with family functions and other things, so I didn’t post updates — but I still managed to make some solid progress on my **MARK1** application!

## 🔍 Search Feature + Group Dropdown

- Built a **search feature** to find users quickly.
- Added a **dropdown** (currently basic) that will later be used for adding users to a group for **group chats**.
- There’s still some more work to do, but I’m getting really close to having everything in place!

## 💪 Excited to Share!

I can’t wait to **showcase MARK1** to my friends and college community — I think they’ll love using this!  
It’s been a fun and challenging journey so far, and I’m really happy with how it’s shaping up.
